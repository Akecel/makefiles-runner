## Extension Settings

- `sortAlphabetically`: Sorts the makefile commands shown in the panel in alphabetical order, defaults to false.  When disabled, commands are shown in the same order as they appear within the makefile itself.
- `displayDescriptionCommentsInPanel"`: Optionally shows the convention-based comment about each command in the makefile as text next to each command in the panel, defaults to true.  Descriptions will be shown on-hover regardless of the value of this setting.
- `alwaysCreateNewTerminal`: Creates a new terminal rather than reusing an existing one when set true, defaults to false.
- `reuseMatchingTerminal`: Reuses the first terminal with a matching command label when set true, defaults to false.  Overrides alwaysCreateNewTerminal if both set true, so new terminals will only be created when running a command with no matching terminal.
